# Introductions (2025)
My name is Faris AlSafi and I was tasked to introduce myself to my Software Engineering Course via a website and so with the help of Eric Pogue and ChatGPT I created this repository as a template for an "Introductions" website.
 
# Background
Computer Engineer Student at the American University of Sharjah
Senior II (at the time of creating this Repository)
